# Conan Character Classification

In this project, I try to use yolov5 to classify 5 characters from Detective Conan The Movie 21 “The Crimson Love Letter”.
The characters that I used are Edogawa Conan, Hattori Heiji, Mouri Ran, Mouri Kogoro, Toyama Kazuha.

For the dataset, I captured face's images from the video file.
Then I used roboflow to label their faces and create dataset.
Some of the images were augmented to increase the dataset.

You can see the results on: https://wandb.ai/beater27/YOLOv5/runs/br0l6pau?workspace=user-beater27
